# Smart-Investment-Optimizing-Portfolio-with-Modern-Portfolio-Theory

Imagine you have ₹1,00,000 and want to invest in multiple stocks (like Apple, Tesla, etc.) — but you don’t know how much to invest in each one.
This project helps you find the best way to divide your money among those stocks to:
* Earn the most return
* While taking as little risk as possible

This is what Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is; a method developed by Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz. It calculates the most efficient mix of assets, meaning you get the best possible return for a given amount of risk. This project uses Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to find the smartest way to invest across multiple stocks by maximizing returns and minimizing risk. It collects historical stock data using yfinance, calculates returns and risk, and uses optimization to find the best asset weights based on the Sharpe Ratio. The project also simulates thousands of random portfolios to visualize the efficient frontier and highlight the optimal one, helping investors make data-driven decisions.
